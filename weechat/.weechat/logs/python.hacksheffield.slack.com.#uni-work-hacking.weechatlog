2017-02-08 22:35:42		StudentHack is an all-inclusive, free and fun programming event for students in Manchester. Turns out it is run by students too. StudentHack is back in its 5th edition and promising to deliver an epic event where you will learn and build awesome hacks, by working together with the team behind GreatUniHack. Format Attendees will have 36 hours to build something awesome, either in hardware or software. There will be workshops to get you going with various technology such as: iOS development, Raspberry pi, Python, etc. Hackers can optionally use sponsor APIs and platforms. At the end of the 36-hour window, people will have time to show either their hack (ready and working), to talk a little about their ideas or what technology they used, what worked and what they had trouble with. We will be providing hardware for attendees and cool gadgets to hack on! Drones, Oculus rifts, Eye trackers, leap motions, myo armbands, muse headband, arduinous, edisons, you name it. Hacks can be made alone or in teams of any size up to 4 members. Teams can be decided at any point before submission and we’ll be having a session for matching up before we start, if you’re unsure of who to work with. The event is free for attendees & we’ll have food and refreshments paid for by our sponsors, as well as prizes for various categories of hacks. FAQs Do you have a website? Yes we do! Check out our website for list of challenges, schedule and sponsors Are there any ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event? You must bring a valid university student ID card to the event. You must also be a full-time university student or have been a student in the past 6 months. You also have to be at least 18 years old. What should I bring? You should bring a laptop to hack on, power extensions, and any other gadget you might need. Sleeping bags are recommended but we have tons of beanbags and airbeds for you to sleep on. Is there a Code of Conduct? Yes, you can access it here: http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf Who owns my IP/code/idea? You own all the rights to your intellectual property. We won't claim any right over anything made during this event. I haven't coded much. Should I come? Definitely. Networking with and seeing awesome hackers in action will expose you to a tremendous amount of knowledge. We also have an amazing suit of industry experts and mentors that are happy to assist you! Still unsure? Then please read an article written by one of the MLH commissioners here.

2017-02-08 22:42:19	joemac	heck ok thanks
2017-02-09 16:55:43	joemac	omg mike stannett is possibly the worst lecturer I've ever had
2017-02-09 17:00:15	sanzi	Whaaaa????
2017-02-09 17:01:52	joemac	do you really like him?
2017-02-09 17:02:01	joemac	he just goes off on wild tangents all the time
2017-02-09 17:02:10	joemac	and is terrible at explaining what he's actually trying to get across
2017-02-09 17:19:24	danny	Hmm he seems quite good for Advanced Programming for us
2017-02-09 17:19:37	danny	I didn't really pay attention today tho
2017-02-09 17:19:42	danny	(Not bc of him)
2017-02-09 19:58:55	joemac	huh
2017-02-09 19:59:12	joemac	*shrug*
2017-02-09 19:59:35	joemac	joemac uploaded a file: https://hacksheffield.slack.com/files/joemac/F42PL8W3T/deepinscreenshot20170209195802.png (DeepinScreenshot20170209195802.png) and commented: @matt
2017-02-09 20:12:15	cgmcintyre	@joemac yeah I agree 
2017-02-09 20:12:30	cgmcintyre	That's why I was wondering why you like advanced programming :no_mouth: 
2017-02-09 20:12:42	joemac	haha it wasn't taught by him when I did it
2017-02-09 20:12:56	joemac	although I can't remember who it was
2017-02-09 20:13:25	cgmcintyre	He's so unfocused, I mean I get the stuff he is teaching is abstract but... 
2017-02-09 20:13:42	joemac	exactly!
2017-02-09 20:14:23	joemac	he just has an idea and you expect him to be like "but that's not really relevant at the moment" or at least "I'll come back to that in a second when I've finished this diagram"
2017-02-09 20:15:01	joemac	but today he was literally midway through explaining turing machines (the aerospace students hadn't done them) and got distracted and started talking about black holes
2017-02-09 20:15:40	danny	*rip*
2017-02-09 20:15:58	danny	I can see where you’re coming from, I’ll give him another chance yet though
2017-02-09 20:17:41	joemac	he was alright face-to-face in project meetings
2017-02-09 20:17:43	joemac	but bad at making me come to project meetings in the first place
2017-02-09 20:17:46	joemac	fair

2017-02-08 22:35:42		StudentHack is an all-inclusive, free and fun programming event for students in Manchester. Turns out it is run by students too. StudentHack is back in its 5th edition and promising to deliver an epic event where you will learn and build awesome hacks, by working together with the team behind GreatUniHack. Format Attendees will have 36 hours to build something awesome, either in hardware or software. There will be workshops to get you going with various technology such as: iOS development, Raspberry pi, Python, etc. Hackers can optionally use sponsor APIs and platforms. At the end of the 36-hour window, people will have time to show either their hack (ready and working), to talk a little about their ideas or what technology they used, what worked and what they had trouble with. We will be providing hardware for attendees and cool gadgets to hack on! Drones, Oculus rifts, Eye trackers, leap motions, myo armbands, muse headband, arduinous, edisons, you name it. Hacks can be made alone or in teams of any size up to 4 members. Teams can be decided at any point before submission and we’ll be having a session for matching up before we start, if you’re unsure of who to work with. The event is free for attendees & we’ll have food and refreshments paid for by our sponsors, as well as prizes for various categories of hacks. FAQs Do you have a website? Yes we do! Check out our website for list of challenges, schedule and sponsors Are there any ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event? You must bring a valid university student ID card to the event. You must also be a full-time university student or have been a student in the past 6 months. You also have to be at least 18 years old. What should I bring? You should bring a laptop to hack on, power extensions, and any other gadget you might need. Sleeping bags are recommended but we have tons of beanbags and airbeds for you to sleep on. Is there a Code of Conduct? Yes, you can access it here: http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf Who owns my IP/code/idea? You own all the rights to your intellectual property. We won't claim any right over anything made during this event. I haven't coded much. Should I come? Definitely. Networking with and seeing awesome hackers in action will expose you to a tremendous amount of knowledge. We also have an amazing suit of industry experts and mentors that are happy to assist you! Still unsure? Then please read an article written by one of the MLH commissioners here.

2017-02-09 17:01:52	joemac	do you really like him?
2017-02-09 17:02:01	joemac	he just goes off on wild tangents all the time
2017-02-09 17:02:10	joemac	and is terrible at explaining what he's actually trying to get across
2017-02-09 17:19:24	danny	Hmm he seems quite good for Advanced Programming for us
2017-02-09 17:19:37	danny	I didn't really pay attention today tho
2017-02-09 17:19:42	danny	(Not bc of him)

2017-02-09 20:12:15	cgmcintyre	@joemac yeah I agree 
2017-02-09 20:12:30	cgmcintyre	That's why I was wondering why you like advanced programming :no_mouth: 
2017-02-09 20:12:42	joemac	haha it wasn't taught by him when I did it
2017-02-09 20:12:56	joemac	although I can't remember who it was
2017-02-09 20:13:25	cgmcintyre	He's so unfocused, I mean I get the stuff he is teaching is abstract but... 
2017-02-09 20:13:42	joemac	exactly!
2017-02-09 20:14:23	joemac	he just has an idea and you expect him to be like "but that's not really relevant at the moment" or at least "I'll come back to that in a second when I've finished this diagram"
2017-02-09 20:15:01	joemac	but today he was literally midway through explaining turing machines (the aerospace students hadn't done them) and got distracted and started talking about black holes
2017-02-09 20:15:40	danny	*rip*
2017-02-09 20:15:58	danny	I can see where you’re coming from, I’ll give him another chance yet though
2017-02-09 20:17:41	joemac	he was alright face-to-face in project meetings
2017-02-09 20:17:43	joemac	but bad at making me come to project meetings in the first place

2017-02-08 22:35:42		StudentHack is an all-inclusive, free and fun programming event for students in Manchester. Turns out it is run by students too. StudentHack is back in its 5th edition and promising to deliver an epic event where you will learn and build awesome hacks, by working together with the team behind GreatUniHack. Format Attendees will have 36 hours to build something awesome, either in hardware or software. There will be workshops to get you going with various technology such as: iOS development, Raspberry pi, Python, etc. Hackers can optionally use sponsor APIs and platforms. At the end of the 36-hour window, people will have time to show either their hack (ready and working), to talk a little about their ideas or what technology they used, what worked and what they had trouble with. We will be providing hardware for attendees and cool gadgets to hack on! Drones, Oculus rifts, Eye trackers, leap motions, myo armbands, muse headband, arduinous, edisons, you name it. Hacks can be made alone or in teams of any size up to 4 members. Teams can be decided at any point before submission and we’ll be having a session for matching up before we start, if you’re unsure of who to work with. The event is free for attendees & we’ll have food and refreshments paid for by our sponsors, as well as prizes for various categories of hacks. FAQs Do you have a website? Yes we do! Check out our website for list of challenges, schedule and sponsors Are there any ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event? You must bring a valid university student ID card to the event. You must also be a full-time university student or have been a student in the past 6 months. You also have to be at least 18 years old. What should I bring? You should bring a laptop to hack on, power extensions, and any other gadget you might need. Sleeping bags are recommended but we have tons of beanbags and airbeds for you to sleep on. Is there a Code of Conduct? Yes, you can access it here: http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf Who owns my IP/code/idea? You own all the rights to your intellectual property. We won't claim any right over anything made during this event. I haven't coded much. Should I come? Definitely. Networking with and seeing awesome hackers in action will expose you to a tremendous amount of knowledge. We also have an amazing suit of industry experts and mentors that are happy to assist you! Still unsure? Then please read an article written by one of the MLH commissioners here.

2017-02-09 17:00:15	sanzi	Whaaaa????
2017-02-09 17:01:52	joemac	do you really like him?
2017-02-09 17:02:01	joemac	he just goes off on wild tangents all the time
2017-02-09 17:02:10	joemac	and is terrible at explaining what he's actually trying to get across
2017-02-09 17:19:24	danny	Hmm he seems quite good for Advanced Programming for us
2017-02-09 17:19:37	danny	I didn't really pay attention today tho
2017-02-09 17:19:42	danny	(Not bc of him)
2017-02-09 19:58:55	joemac	huh
2017-02-09 19:59:12	joemac	*shrug*

2017-02-09 20:12:15	cgmcintyre	@joemac yeah I agree 
2017-02-09 20:12:30	cgmcintyre	That's why I was wondering why you like advanced programming :no_mouth: 
2017-02-09 20:12:42	joemac	haha it wasn't taught by him when I did it
2017-02-09 20:12:56	joemac	although I can't remember who it was
2017-02-09 20:13:25	cgmcintyre	He's so unfocused, I mean I get the stuff he is teaching is abstract but... 
2017-02-09 20:13:42	joemac	exactly!
2017-02-09 20:14:23	joemac	he just has an idea and you expect him to be like "but that's not really relevant at the moment" or at least "I'll come back to that in a second when I've finished this diagram"
2017-02-09 20:15:01	joemac	but today he was literally midway through explaining turing machines (the aerospace students hadn't done them) and got distracted and started talking about black holes
2017-02-09 20:15:40	danny	*rip*
2017-02-09 20:15:58	danny	I can see where you’re coming from, I’ll give him another chance yet though
2017-02-09 20:17:41	joemac	he was alright face-to-face in project meetings
2017-02-09 20:17:43	joemac	but bad at making me come to project meetings in the first place
2017-02-09 20:17:46	joemac	fair

2017-02-08 22:35:42		StudentHack is an all-inclusive, free and fun programming event for students in Manchester. Turns out it is run by students too. StudentHack is back in its 5th edition and promising to deliver an epic event where you will learn and build awesome hacks, by working together with the team behind GreatUniHack. Format Attendees will have 36 hours to build something awesome, either in hardware or software. There will be workshops to get you going with various technology such as: iOS development, Raspberry pi, Python, etc. Hackers can optionally use sponsor APIs and platforms. At the end of the 36-hour window, people will have time to show either their hack (ready and working), to talk a little about their ideas or what technology they used, what worked and what they had trouble with. We will be providing hardware for attendees and cool gadgets to hack on! Drones, Oculus rifts, Eye trackers, leap motions, myo armbands, muse headband, arduinous, edisons, you name it. Hacks can be made alone or in teams of any size up to 4 members. Teams can be decided at any point before submission and we’ll be having a session for matching up before we start, if you’re unsure of who to work with. The event is free for attendees & we’ll have food and refreshments paid for by our sponsors, as well as prizes for various categories of hacks. FAQs Do you have a website? Yes we do! Check out our website for list of challenges, schedule and sponsors Are there any ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event? You must bring a valid university student ID card to the event. You must also be a full-time university student or have been a student in the past 6 months. You also have to be at least 18 years old. What should I bring? You should bring a laptop to hack on, power extensions, and any other gadget you might need. Sleeping bags are recommended but we have tons of beanbags and airbeds for you to sleep on. Is there a Code of Conduct? Yes, you can access it here: http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf Who owns my IP/code/idea? You own all the rights to your intellectual property. We won't claim any right over anything made during this event. I haven't coded much. Should I come? Definitely. Networking with and seeing awesome hackers in action will expose you to a tremendous amount of knowledge. We also have an amazing suit of industry experts and mentors that are happy to assist you! Still unsure? Then please read an article written by one of the MLH commissioners here.

2017-02-09 17:01:52	joemac	do you really like him?
2017-02-09 17:02:01	joemac	he just goes off on wild tangents all the time
2017-02-09 17:02:10	joemac	and is terrible at explaining what he's actually trying to get across
2017-02-09 17:19:24	danny	Hmm he seems quite good for Advanced Programming for us
2017-02-09 17:19:37	danny	I didn't really pay attention today tho
2017-02-09 17:19:42	danny	(Not bc of him)

2017-02-09 20:12:15	cgmcintyre	@joemac yeah I agree 
2017-02-09 20:12:30	cgmcintyre	That's why I was wondering why you like advanced programming :no_mouth: 
2017-02-09 20:12:42	joemac	haha it wasn't taught by him when I did it
2017-02-09 20:12:56	joemac	although I can't remember who it was
2017-02-09 20:13:25	cgmcintyre	He's so unfocused, I mean I get the stuff he is teaching is abstract but... 
2017-02-09 20:13:42	joemac	exactly!
2017-02-09 20:14:23	joemac	he just has an idea and you expect him to be like "but that's not really relevant at the moment" or at least "I'll come back to that in a second when I've finished this diagram"
2017-02-09 20:15:01	joemac	but today he was literally midway through explaining turing machines (the aerospace students hadn't done them) and got distracted and started talking about black holes
2017-02-09 20:15:40	danny	*rip*
2017-02-09 20:15:58	danny	I can see where you’re coming from, I’ll give him another chance yet though

2017-02-08 22:35:42		StudentHack is an all-inclusive, free and fun programming event for students in Manchester. Turns out it is run by students too. StudentHack is back in its 5th edition and promising to deliver an epic event where you will learn and build awesome hacks, by working together with the team behind GreatUniHack. Format Attendees will have 36 hours to build something awesome, either in hardware or software. There will be workshops to get you going with various technology such as: iOS development, Raspberry pi, Python, etc. Hackers can optionally use sponsor APIs and platforms. At the end of the 36-hour window, people will have time to show either their hack (ready and working), to talk a little about their ideas or what technology they used, what worked and what they had trouble with. We will be providing hardware for attendees and cool gadgets to hack on! Drones, Oculus rifts, Eye trackers, leap motions, myo armbands, muse headband, arduinous, edisons, you name it. Hacks can be made alone or in teams of any size up to 4 members. Teams can be decided at any point before submission and we’ll be having a session for matching up before we start, if you’re unsure of who to work with. The event is free for attendees & we’ll have food and refreshments paid for by our sponsors, as well as prizes for various categories of hacks. FAQs Do you have a website? Yes we do! Check out our website for list of challenges, schedule and sponsors Are there any ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event? You must bring a valid university student ID card to the event. You must also be a full-time university student or have been a student in the past 6 months. You also have to be at least 18 years old. What should I bring? You should bring a laptop to hack on, power extensions, and any other gadget you might need. Sleeping bags are recommended but we have tons of beanbags and airbeds for you to sleep on. Is there a Code of Conduct? Yes, you can access it here: http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf Who owns my IP/code/idea? You own all the rights to your intellectual property. We won't claim any right over anything made during this event. I haven't coded much. Should I come? Definitely. Networking with and seeing awesome hackers in action will expose you to a tremendous amount of knowledge. We also have an amazing suit of industry experts and mentors that are happy to assist you! Still unsure? Then please read an article written by one of the MLH commissioners here.

2017-02-08 22:42:19	joemac	heck ok thanks
2017-02-09 16:55:43	joemac	omg mike stannett is possibly the worst lecturer I've ever had
2017-02-09 17:00:15	sanzi	Whaaaa????
2017-02-09 17:01:52	joemac	do you really like him?
2017-02-09 17:02:01	joemac	he just goes off on wild tangents all the time
2017-02-09 17:02:10	joemac	and is terrible at explaining what he's actually trying to get across
2017-02-09 17:19:24	danny	Hmm he seems quite good for Advanced Programming for us
2017-02-09 17:19:37	danny	I didn't really pay attention today tho
2017-02-09 17:19:42	danny	(Not bc of him)
2017-02-09 19:58:55	joemac	huh
2017-02-09 19:59:12	joemac	*shrug*
2017-02-09 19:59:35	joemac	joemac uploaded a file: https://hacksheffield.slack.com/files/joemac/F42PL8W3T/deepinscreenshot20170209195802.png (DeepinScreenshot20170209195802.png) and commented: @matt
2017-02-09 20:12:15	cgmcintyre	@joemac yeah I agree 
2017-02-09 20:12:30	cgmcintyre	That's why I was wondering why you like advanced programming :no_mouth: 
2017-02-09 20:12:42	joemac	haha it wasn't taught by him when I did it
2017-02-09 20:12:56	joemac	although I can't remember who it was
2017-02-09 20:13:25	cgmcintyre	He's so unfocused, I mean I get the stuff he is teaching is abstract but... 
2017-02-09 20:13:42	joemac	exactly!
2017-02-09 20:14:23	joemac	he just has an idea and you expect him to be like "but that's not really relevant at the moment" or at least "I'll come back to that in a second when I've finished this diagram"
2017-02-09 20:15:01	joemac	but today he was literally midway through explaining turing machines (the aerospace students hadn't done them) and got distracted and started talking about black holes
2017-02-09 20:15:40	danny	*rip*
2017-02-09 20:15:58	danny	I can see where you’re coming from, I’ll give him another chance yet though
2017-02-09 20:17:41	joemac	he was alright face-to-face in project meetings
2017-02-09 20:17:43	joemac	but bad at making me come to project meetings in the first place
2017-02-09 20:17:46	joemac	fair
2017-02-10 17:43:01	matt	where can i find georg’s questions and solutions?
2017-02-10 17:44:07	matt	seems to be last year’s questions at https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/G.Struth/campus_only/automatalogiccomputation/ml.html but no solutions?

2017-02-08 22:35:42		StudentHack is an all-inclusive, free and fun programming event for students in Manchester. Turns out it is run by students too. StudentHack is back in its 5th edition and promising to deliver an epic event where you will learn and build awesome hacks, by working together with the team behind GreatUniHack. Format Attendees will have 36 hours to build something awesome, either in hardware or software. There will be workshops to get you going with various technology such as: iOS development, Raspberry pi, Python, etc. Hackers can optionally use sponsor APIs and platforms. At the end of the 36-hour window, people will have time to show either their hack (ready and working), to talk a little about their ideas or what technology they used, what worked and what they had trouble with. We will be providing hardware for attendees and cool gadgets to hack on! Drones, Oculus rifts, Eye trackers, leap motions, myo armbands, muse headband, arduinous, edisons, you name it. Hacks can be made alone or in teams of any size up to 4 members. Teams can be decided at any point before submission and we’ll be having a session for matching up before we start, if you’re unsure of who to work with. The event is free for attendees & we’ll have food and refreshments paid for by our sponsors, as well as prizes for various categories of hacks. FAQs Do you have a website? Yes we do! Check out our website for list of challenges, schedule and sponsors Are there any ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event? You must bring a valid university student ID card to the event. You must also be a full-time university student or have been a student in the past 6 months. You also have to be at least 18 years old. What should I bring? You should bring a laptop to hack on, power extensions, and any other gadget you might need. Sleeping bags are recommended but we have tons of beanbags and airbeds for you to sleep on. Is there a Code of Conduct? Yes, you can access it here: http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf Who owns my IP/code/idea? You own all the rights to your intellectual property. We won't claim any right over anything made during this event. I haven't coded much. Should I come? Definitely. Networking with and seeing awesome hackers in action will expose you to a tremendous amount of knowledge. We also have an amazing suit of industry experts and mentors that are happy to assist you! Still unsure? Then please read an article written by one of the MLH commissioners here.

2017-02-09 16:55:43	joemac	omg mike stannett is possibly the worst lecturer I've ever had
2017-02-09 17:00:15	sanzi	Whaaaa????
2017-02-09 17:01:52	joemac	do you really like him?
2017-02-09 17:02:01	joemac	he just goes off on wild tangents all the time
2017-02-09 17:02:10	joemac	and is terrible at explaining what he's actually trying to get across
2017-02-09 17:19:24	danny	Hmm he seems quite good for Advanced Programming for us
2017-02-09 17:19:37	danny	I didn't really pay attention today tho
2017-02-09 17:19:42	danny	(Not bc of him)
2017-02-09 19:58:55	joemac	huh
2017-02-09 19:59:12	joemac	*shrug*
2017-02-09 19:59:35	joemac	joemac uploaded a file: https://hacksheffield.slack.com/files/joemac/F42PL8W3T/deepinscreenshot20170209195802.png (DeepinScreenshot20170209195802.png) and commented: @matt
2017-02-09 20:12:15	cgmcintyre	@joemac yeah I agree 
2017-02-09 20:12:30	cgmcintyre	That's why I was wondering why you like advanced programming :no_mouth: 
2017-02-09 20:12:42	joemac	haha it wasn't taught by him when I did it
2017-02-09 20:12:56	joemac	although I can't remember who it was
2017-02-09 20:13:25	cgmcintyre	He's so unfocused, I mean I get the stuff he is teaching is abstract but... 
2017-02-09 20:13:42	joemac	exactly!
2017-02-09 20:14:23	joemac	he just has an idea and you expect him to be like "but that's not really relevant at the moment" or at least "I'll come back to that in a second when I've finished this diagram"
2017-02-09 20:15:01	joemac	but today he was literally midway through explaining turing machines (the aerospace students hadn't done them) and got distracted and started talking about black holes
2017-02-09 20:15:40	danny	*rip*
2017-02-09 20:15:58	danny	I can see where you’re coming from, I’ll give him another chance yet though
2017-02-09 20:17:41	joemac	he was alright face-to-face in project meetings
2017-02-09 20:17:43	joemac	but bad at making me come to project meetings in the first place
2017-02-09 20:17:46	joemac	fair
