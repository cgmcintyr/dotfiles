2016-11-23 14:06:06		Dear Maria,
2016-11-23 14:06:06		I’d like to apply for the On CampUS placement job to create an ‘Online system for medical risk calculation’. As you know, I’m a second-year Computer Science student interested in getting real world experience.
2016-11-23 14:06:06		I’ve worked with REST API endpoints before now such as the Google Places API at hackathons in the previous year and built up an MVP REST API for my software engineering project in my first year. I’m experienced with front end development using HTML, CSS, and JS. I’m also very interested in utilising Node.JS in a project and constructing a full stack using JavaScript. I’ve used JUnit before and I’ve researched testing frameworks such as Mocha.JS.
2016-11-23 14:06:06		I work well as part of a team and manage my time well, prioritising deadlines effectively.
2016-11-23 14:06:06		I’m already familiar with a few of the members of the OAK group and would look forward to working with you.
2016-11-23 14:06:06		Please also find my CV attached to the email.
2016-11-23 14:06:06		Yours sincerely,
2016-11-23 14:06:06		Daniel Carl Jones

2016-11-23 14:06:06		Dear Maria,
2016-11-23 14:06:06		I’d like to apply for the On CampUS placement job to create an ‘Online system for medical risk calculation’. As you know, I’m a second-year Computer Science student interested in getting real world experience.
2016-11-23 14:06:06		I’ve worked with REST API endpoints before now such as the Google Places API at hackathons in the previous year and built up an MVP REST API for my software engineering project in my first year. I’m experienced with front end development using HTML, CSS, and JS. I’m also very interested in utilising Node.JS in a project and constructing a full stack using JavaScript. I’ve used JUnit before and I’ve researched testing frameworks such as Mocha.JS.
2016-11-23 14:06:06		I work well as part of a team and manage my time well, prioritising deadlines effectively.
2016-11-23 14:06:06		I’m already familiar with a few of the members of the OAK group and would look forward to working with you.
2016-11-23 14:06:06		Please also find my CV attached to the email.
2016-11-23 14:06:06		Yours sincerely,
