2017-01-31 11:40:44	sanzi	Guys, there's no room booked for this afternoon, and I was thinking it's probably best to start having meetings again next week, when we'll all be back to normal, not having GEC/EYH to annoy us and deprive us of sleep
2017-01-31 11:40:49	sanzi	If that makes any sense
2017-01-31 11:41:06	sanzi	Lemme know what y'all think, !channel
2017-01-31 11:52:22	gregives	Yeah that sounds fine, I'm not getting back to Sheffield till later today so not sure if I would be able to make it anyway
2017-01-31 12:35:04	matt	I agree
2017-01-31 12:35:17	matt	Will probably be a big backlog for first meeting 
2017-01-31 12:57:06	luana	I'll be around the diamond at 5:30/6 anyways.... if we're serious about the mini events I think we should start planning soon. Unit tests don't code themselves.... but I am fine with meeting next week (edited)
2017-01-31 13:10:38	danny	I've died and it's only day 2, so if I revived next week you might see me there

2017-02-12 10:43:11	jacob	Might be cool to do a uni vs Hallam thing
2017-02-12 10:43:14	jacob	Imagine that
2017-02-12 10:45:11	matt	best to not advertise stuff until it’s got a solid plan in place like compsoc do
2017-02-12 10:48:48	matt	my sentence is bad. i mean like when compsoc advertised their events before they had a plan so most of them never happened [:+1:2]
2017-02-12 11:13:55	luana	I'll prepare a set of questions and a time table until thursday (meeting, right?) Then we can think about who does what and if we want to do include hallam
2017-02-12 11:14:39	luana	Or do you want to do a separate challenge? Like doing 2? That would be huge work @jacob
2017-02-12 11:14:44	matt	yeah thursday [:unicorn_face:1]
2017-02-12 11:15:03	matt	let’s keep it as simple as possible
2017-02-12 11:15:22	luana	Agree
2017-02-12 11:15:45	matt	it’s not been validated as a concept yet so let’s start small and iterate on it
2017-02-12 11:17:12	luana	Yeah true :) let's first make a plan and discuss if it is realistic and we can cope with it [:+1:1]
2017-02-12 11:38:32	jacob	Anyone fancy playing 5 a side at 2? [:football:1]
2017-02-12 11:38:35	jacob	We're down one

2017-02-10 16:05:02	jacob	Getting to the university from the station is not a difficult task
2017-02-10 16:05:12	jacob	How are we doing that btw?
2017-02-10 16:12:20	danny	No problem with being early, we can visit the cat cafe

2017-02-10 19:13:40	matt	Can anyone just send to eng-ug???
2017-02-10 19:16:35	danny	You might get slightly reprimanded for that
2017-02-11 21:18:27	danny	>Are there any activities at all coming up in the society?
2017-02-11 21:18:27		We received a message. Thoughts?

2017-02-11 21:19:05	matt	wit and hackathon trips :thumbsup: [:+1:1] (edited)
2017-02-12 10:43:11	jacob	Might be cool to do a uni vs Hallam thing
2017-02-12 10:43:14	jacob	Imagine that
2017-02-12 10:45:11	matt	best to not advertise stuff until it’s got a solid plan in place like compsoc do
2017-02-12 10:48:48	matt	my sentence is bad. i mean like when compsoc advertised their events before they had a plan so most of them never happened [:+1:2]
2017-02-12 11:13:55	luana	I'll prepare a set of questions and a time table until thursday (meeting, right?) Then we can think about who does what and if we want to do include hallam
2017-02-12 11:14:39	luana	Or do you want to do a separate challenge? Like doing 2? That would be huge work @jacob
2017-02-12 11:14:44	matt	yeah thursday [:unicorn_face:1]
2017-02-12 11:15:03	matt	let’s keep it as simple as possible
2017-02-12 11:15:22	luana	Agree
2017-02-12 11:15:45	matt	it’s not been validated as a concept yet so let’s start small and iterate on it
2017-02-12 11:17:12	luana	Yeah true :) let's first make a plan and discuss if it is realistic and we can cope with it [:+1:1]
2017-02-12 11:38:32	jacob	Anyone fancy playing 5 a side at 2? [:football:1]
2017-02-12 11:38:35	jacob	We're down one
2017-02-12 11:46:08	danny	Is that the game where there’s a ball or smth and you kick it?
2017-02-12 11:46:12	danny	(My answer is no)
