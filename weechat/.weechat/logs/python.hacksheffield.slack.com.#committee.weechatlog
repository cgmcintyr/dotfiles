2017-01-10 18:17:31	danny	but more seriously, I’d say not to distribute them. If a company wants their job offering distributed to our members they can sponsor us, otherwise they can be listed on job websites like careers connect and we should point members to sponsors and the careers service or w/e
2017-01-10 23:08:32	jacob	might be worth coming up with a standard response

2017-02-03 17:05:26	danny	We’re thinking of £50 reimbursement for HackUPC
2017-02-03 17:05:40	danny	Mainly so that people have the option to return earlier (rather than 7 days)
2017-02-03 17:05:46	danny	Thoughts !channel?
2017-02-03 17:07:03	sanzi	I agree, pls come back earlier than a week  [:sparkling_heart:1]
2017-02-03 17:09:57	danny	mainly @jacob
2017-02-03 17:13:05	jacob	What do HackUPC provide as reimbursement?
2017-02-03 17:13:14	danny	€100 / £88
2017-02-03 17:13:31	danny	basically it costs another £40-50 to come back earlier
2017-02-03 17:13:33	jacob	Why don't we buy tickets
2017-02-03 17:13:38	jacob	We could find tix
2017-02-03 17:14:09	danny	£106 each for tickets
2017-02-03 17:14:30	jacob	I meant *fund tix
2017-02-03 17:14:48	danny	Yeah, the £50 would be to go towards tickets
2017-02-03 17:15:00	danny	along w/ the €100 from HackUPC
2017-02-03 17:15:14	danny	Anything left over also goes towards Hostel
2017-02-03 17:18:31	danny	(@jacob)
2017-02-03 17:24:08	sanzi	@jacob I assume you agree?

2016-12-15 15:12:46	matt	…as in, empower the first years to go all out :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
2016-12-15 15:13:10	danny	Yeah
2016-12-15 15:13:24	danny	Basically, we’re feeling burnt out from this semester
2016-12-15 15:13:29	danny	MEE and DCS are feeling the same
2016-12-15 15:13:58	danny	and given that the last few experiences they’ve had w/ these events is us oversubscribing and CompSoc turning up w/o prior conversation/organisation, it’s not the best situation
2016-12-15 15:15:56	matt	we should have a decent idea of where to go next after the weekend plus monday :slightly_smiling_face:
2016-12-15 15:16:15	danny	Hopefully yeah
2016-12-15 15:16:28	danny	I mean we’ll vote on Thursday when we know what the situation is like
2016-12-15 15:17:05	danny	I’m not sure if @sanzi has access to society room bookings, but we *might* be able to find out about Departmental Open Days and what weekends to avoid too without bothering Pam
2016-12-15 16:00:17	jacob	you can ask Stacey about open days
2016-12-15 16:00:39	sanzi	Yeah, that's what Ramsay said as well

2016-12-21 18:20:32	sanzi	People who aren't owners in  the GitHub organization don't seem to be able to see the private repos
2016-12-21 18:29:54	danny	okay so i might have fixed that?
2016-12-21 18:31:54	matt	i added everyone to organisers apart from isaac who is forever pending (everyone else was instant)
2016-12-21 18:32:07	matt	and added team permissions to 3 and soc

2016-12-21 18:37:59	matt	issues still have to go in repos
2016-12-21 18:39:10	matt	i guess it only makes sense to have a project outside of a repo if it’s referncing thigns for loads of repos

2017-01-10 18:17:31	danny	but more seriously, I’d say not to distribute them. If a company wants their job offering distributed to our members they can sponsor us, otherwise they can be listed on job websites like careers connect and we should point members to sponsors and the careers service or w/e
2017-01-10 23:08:32	jacob	might be worth coming up with a standard response

2017-02-03 17:05:26	danny	We’re thinking of £50 reimbursement for HackUPC
2017-02-03 17:05:40	danny	Mainly so that people have the option to return earlier (rather than 7 days)
2017-02-03 17:05:46	danny	Thoughts !channel?
2017-02-03 17:07:03	sanzi	I agree, pls come back earlier than a week  [:sparkling_heart:1]

2017-02-03 17:13:05	jacob	What do HackUPC provide as reimbursement?
2017-02-03 17:13:14	danny	€100 / £88
2017-02-03 17:13:31	danny	basically it costs another £40-50 to come back earlier
2017-02-03 17:13:33	jacob	Why don't we buy tickets
2017-02-03 17:13:38	jacob	We could find tix
2017-02-03 17:14:09	danny	£106 each for tickets
2017-02-03 17:14:30	jacob	I meant *fund tix
2017-02-03 17:14:48	danny	Yeah, the £50 would be to go towards tickets

2016-12-15 15:13:58	danny	and given that the last few experiences they’ve had w/ these events is us oversubscribing and CompSoc turning up w/o prior conversation/organisation, it’s not the best situation

2016-12-21 18:37:59	matt	issues still have to go in repos
2016-12-21 18:39:10	matt	i guess it only makes sense to have a project outside of a repo if it’s referncing thigns for loads of repos

2017-01-10 18:17:31	danny	but more seriously, I’d say not to distribute them. If a company wants their job offering distributed to our members they can sponsor us, otherwise they can be listed on job websites like careers connect and we should point members to sponsors and the careers service or w/e
2017-01-10 23:08:32	jacob	might be worth coming up with a standard response
2017-01-10 23:08:44	jacob	"get yo shit on career connect... unless you fancy sponsoring. let's talk business."

2017-02-03 17:05:26	danny	We’re thinking of £50 reimbursement for HackUPC
2017-02-03 17:05:40	danny	Mainly so that people have the option to return earlier (rather than 7 days)
2017-02-03 17:05:46	danny	Thoughts !channel?
2017-02-03 17:07:03	sanzi	I agree, pls come back earlier than a week  [:sparkling_heart:1]

2017-02-03 17:13:14	danny	€100 / £88
2017-02-03 17:13:31	danny	basically it costs another £40-50 to come back earlier
2017-02-03 17:13:33	jacob	Why don't we buy tickets
2017-02-03 17:13:38	jacob	We could find tix
2017-02-03 17:14:09	danny	£106 each for tickets
2017-02-03 17:14:30	jacob	I meant *fund tix
2017-02-03 17:14:48	danny	Yeah, the £50 would be to go towards tickets
2017-02-03 17:15:00	danny	along w/ the €100 from HackUPC

2016-12-15 15:13:24	danny	Basically, we’re feeling burnt out from this semester
2016-12-15 15:13:29	danny	MEE and DCS are feeling the same
2016-12-15 15:13:58	danny	and given that the last few experiences they’ve had w/ these events is us oversubscribing and CompSoc turning up w/o prior conversation/organisation, it’s not the best situation
2016-12-15 15:15:56	matt	we should have a decent idea of where to go next after the weekend plus monday :slightly_smiling_face:
2016-12-15 15:16:15	danny	Hopefully yeah
2016-12-15 15:16:28	danny	I mean we’ll vote on Thursday when we know what the situation is like
2016-12-15 15:17:05	danny	I’m not sure if @sanzi has access to society room bookings, but we *might* be able to find out about Departmental Open Days and what weekends to avoid too without bothering Pam

2016-12-21 18:37:59	matt	issues still have to go in repos
2016-12-21 18:39:10	matt	i guess it only makes sense to have a project outside of a repo if it’s referncing thigns for loads of repos

2017-01-10 18:17:31	danny	but more seriously, I’d say not to distribute them. If a company wants their job offering distributed to our members they can sponsor us, otherwise they can be listed on job websites like careers connect and we should point members to sponsors and the careers service or w/e
2017-01-10 23:08:32	jacob	might be worth coming up with a standard response
2017-01-10 23:08:44	jacob	"get yo shit on career connect... unless you fancy sponsoring. let's talk business."

2017-02-03 17:05:26	danny	We’re thinking of £50 reimbursement for HackUPC
2017-02-03 17:05:40	danny	Mainly so that people have the option to return earlier (rather than 7 days)
2017-02-03 17:05:46	danny	Thoughts !channel?
2017-02-03 17:07:03	sanzi	I agree, pls come back earlier than a week  [:sparkling_heart:1]

2017-02-03 17:13:05	jacob	What do HackUPC provide as reimbursement?
2017-02-03 17:13:14	danny	€100 / £88
2017-02-03 17:13:31	danny	basically it costs another £40-50 to come back earlier
2017-02-03 17:13:33	jacob	Why don't we buy tickets
2017-02-03 17:13:38	jacob	We could find tix
2017-02-03 17:14:09	danny	£106 each for tickets
2017-02-03 17:14:30	jacob	I meant *fund tix
2017-02-03 17:14:48	danny	Yeah, the £50 would be to go towards tickets

2016-12-15 15:13:58	danny	and given that the last few experiences they’ve had w/ these events is us oversubscribing and CompSoc turning up w/o prior conversation/organisation, it’s not the best situation

2017-01-10 18:17:31	danny	but more seriously, I’d say not to distribute them. If a company wants their job offering distributed to our members they can sponsor us, otherwise they can be listed on job websites like careers connect and we should point members to sponsors and the careers service or w/e
2017-01-10 23:08:32	jacob	might be worth coming up with a standard response
2017-01-10 23:08:44	jacob	"get yo shit on career connect... unless you fancy sponsoring. let's talk business."

2017-02-03 17:05:26	danny	We’re thinking of £50 reimbursement for HackUPC
2017-02-03 17:05:40	danny	Mainly so that people have the option to return earlier (rather than 7 days)
2017-02-03 17:05:46	danny	Thoughts !channel?
2017-02-03 17:07:03	sanzi	I agree, pls come back earlier than a week  [:sparkling_heart:1]
2017-02-03 17:09:57	danny	mainly @jacob
2017-02-03 17:13:05	jacob	What do HackUPC provide as reimbursement?
2017-02-03 17:13:14	danny	€100 / £88
2017-02-03 17:13:31	danny	basically it costs another £40-50 to come back earlier
2017-02-03 17:13:33	jacob	Why don't we buy tickets
2017-02-03 17:13:38	jacob	We could find tix
2017-02-03 17:14:09	danny	£106 each for tickets
2017-02-03 17:14:30	jacob	I meant *fund tix
2017-02-03 17:14:48	danny	Yeah, the £50 would be to go towards tickets
2017-02-03 17:15:00	danny	along w/ the €100 from HackUPC
2017-02-03 17:15:14	danny	Anything left over also goes towards Hostel

2016-12-15 15:13:24	danny	Basically, we’re feeling burnt out from this semester
2016-12-15 15:13:29	danny	MEE and DCS are feeling the same
2016-12-15 15:13:58	danny	and given that the last few experiences they’ve had w/ these events is us oversubscribing and CompSoc turning up w/o prior conversation/organisation, it’s not the best situation
2016-12-15 15:15:56	matt	we should have a decent idea of where to go next after the weekend plus monday :slightly_smiling_face:
2016-12-15 15:16:15	danny	Hopefully yeah

2016-12-21 18:29:54	danny	okay so i might have fixed that?

2016-12-21 18:37:59	matt	issues still have to go in repos
2016-12-21 18:39:10	matt	i guess it only makes sense to have a project outside of a repo if it’s referncing thigns for loads of repos

2017-01-10 18:17:31	danny	but more seriously, I’d say not to distribute them. If a company wants their job offering distributed to our members they can sponsor us, otherwise they can be listed on job websites like careers connect and we should point members to sponsors and the careers service or w/e
2017-01-10 23:08:32	jacob	might be worth coming up with a standard response
2017-01-10 23:08:44	jacob	"get yo shit on career connect... unless you fancy sponsoring. let's talk business."

2017-02-03 17:05:26	danny	We’re thinking of £50 reimbursement for HackUPC
2017-02-03 17:05:40	danny	Mainly so that people have the option to return earlier (rather than 7 days)
2017-02-03 17:05:46	danny	Thoughts !channel?
2017-02-03 17:07:03	sanzi	I agree, pls come back earlier than a week  [:sparkling_heart:1]
2017-02-03 17:09:57	danny	mainly @jacob
2017-02-03 17:13:05	jacob	What do HackUPC provide as reimbursement?
2017-02-03 17:13:14	danny	€100 / £88
2017-02-03 17:13:31	danny	basically it costs another £40-50 to come back earlier
2017-02-03 17:13:33	jacob	Why don't we buy tickets
2017-02-03 17:13:38	jacob	We could find tix
2017-02-03 17:14:09	danny	£106 each for tickets
2017-02-03 17:14:30	jacob	I meant *fund tix
2017-02-03 17:14:48	danny	Yeah, the £50 would be to go towards tickets
2017-02-03 17:15:00	danny	along w/ the €100 from HackUPC
2017-02-03 17:15:14	danny	Anything left over also goes towards Hostel

2017-01-10 18:17:31	danny	but more seriously, I’d say not to distribute them. If a company wants their job offering distributed to our members they can sponsor us, otherwise they can be listed on job websites like careers connect and we should point members to sponsors and the careers service or w/e
2017-01-10 23:08:32	jacob	might be worth coming up with a standard response

2017-02-03 17:05:26	danny	We’re thinking of £50 reimbursement for HackUPC
2017-02-03 17:05:40	danny	Mainly so that people have the option to return earlier (rather than 7 days)
2017-02-03 17:05:46	danny	Thoughts !channel?
2017-02-03 17:07:03	sanzi	I agree, pls come back earlier than a week  [:sparkling_heart:1]

2017-02-03 17:13:14	danny	€100 / £88
2017-02-03 17:13:31	danny	basically it costs another £40-50 to come back earlier
2017-02-03 17:13:33	jacob	Why don't we buy tickets
2017-02-03 17:13:38	jacob	We could find tix
2017-02-03 17:14:09	danny	£106 each for tickets
2017-02-03 17:14:30	jacob	I meant *fund tix
2017-02-03 17:14:48	danny	Yeah, the £50 would be to go towards tickets
