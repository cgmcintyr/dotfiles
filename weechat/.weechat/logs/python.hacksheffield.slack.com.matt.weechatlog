2016-12-09 14:09:41	matt	No why
2016-12-09 14:12:24	cgmcintyre	Can we catch up when you get back? The EGM needs to be organised :no_mouth: 
2016-12-09 14:15:58	matt	Do we not just turn up, ask who's standing, then do votes on whoever's standing for each position?
2016-12-09 14:16:09	matt	After they speak if they so wish
2016-12-09 14:16:39	matt	What is there to organise?
2016-12-09 14:16:53	cgmcintyre	There's a way the EGM has to be run for it to be recognised by the SU
2016-12-09 14:17:36	cgmcintyre	Would be good to look through the SU's document on running elections so we don't have to do it again :ok_hand: 
2016-12-09 14:19:47	matt	Agenda
2016-12-09 14:20:01	matt	3 working days prior
2016-12-09 14:20:27	matt	Take minutes, record votes
2016-12-09 14:20:28	cgmcintyre	Have we done that?
2016-12-09 14:21:33	matt	Let me check Danny's email
2016-12-09 14:22:09	cgmcintyre	Also this is the last meeting before Christmas holidays, I feel like people need to be organised and know what's going on/what they should be doing 
2016-12-09 14:22:10	matt	I mean not really
2016-12-09 14:22:26	matt	matt uploaded a file: https://hacksheffield.slack.com/files/matt/F3CQR8HM0/slack_for_ios_upload.jpg (Slack for iOS Upload)
2016-12-09 14:22:36	matt	Yeah. Definitely. All blocked on venue rn :s
2016-12-09 14:23:24	matt	It's not like "this is the agenda"
2016-12-09 14:31:56	matt	Is there anything else we need to organise?
2016-12-09 14:32:41	cgmcintyre	Hmm I guess not 
2016-12-09 14:33:45	matt	Does jack need to officially step down with some official process?
2016-12-09 14:33:55	matt	Or is that the whole point of the egm
2016-12-09 15:05:44	cgmcintyre	Has he not stepped down? He needs to step down before the EGM
2016-12-09 15:17:04	matt	Obviously he has, just to what official degree idk?
2016-12-09 15:19:01	cgmcintyre	I'm not sure tbh
2016-12-09 15:32:39	matt	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-12-14 15:25:56	cgmcintyre	Hey man, we should meet up to chat properly about what we're doing - I feel like running into a march hackathon with a committee of people who don't want to run one is a bad idea
